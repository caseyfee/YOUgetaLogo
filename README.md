# YOUgetaLogo

![Oprah](./READMEimgs/oprah.jpeg)

## Description: 
This project was created to enable a user to quickly and easily generate a logo. This code package used inquirer, fs methods, npm, an understanding of node_modules, directories, and so much more. This project generates a logo correctly, however, the Jest Tests were not running correctly due to me getting the norovirus this week from Thursday-Monday, when I have time, I will come back to it and finish it! I started updating the test code in the direction I'm pretty sure it needs to go, but alas, life had other plans.
